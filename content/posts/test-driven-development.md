Let's get _Test Infected_!

Over the past few months I have learned quite a bit about *Test-Driven Development* or **TDD**.
The other day I was sharing some of the knowledge I gained with a fellow aspiring developer.
My late night discord ramblings were a little disorganised.
So that gave me the inspiration to write the first real post on my website!

Before we get to far into it, we need to remember that the Test-Driven Development process is a **tool**.
I have done some experimentation with the TDD process while learning about it, however, I have not used this process for a full project.

## What is Test-Driven Development?

Test-Driven Development is the process of writing "clean code that works"[^1].
For this article we'll focus on *"that works"*, clean code will emerge, but it is not our current focus[^2].

[^1]: Attributed to Ron Jeffries in the preface of Kent Beck's famous book "Test-Driven Development - By Example".
[^2]: I am currently reading "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin, so look out for an article on this possibly.

When practicing TDD we write our tests before writing code.
This doesn't mean that TDD is about testing, TDD is about design, documentation, and communication.

### Design

We want to consider what our code will do before we think about how it will do it.

### Documentation and Communication

### It's not about...

Test-Driven Development is not about finding bugs.
Preventing bugs from 

## Why should you try TDD?

- helps to solve tricky problems
- easier to maintain and extend
- better planning

## How does TDD work?

- red, green refactor
- write a failing test
- quickly make the test pass
- clean up the code
- - rename
- - rewrite
- - split out complexity
